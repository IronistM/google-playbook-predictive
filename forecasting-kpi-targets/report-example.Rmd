We used the [prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/installation.html) R package to create a forecasting model.

We used 2 years of historical data from [Google Anayltics 360 BigQuery Export](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3437618?hl=en)

Finally, it's likely that we can automate a solution that will generate additional incremental business value by delivering this forecasting model into a dashboard of choice (Data Studio, Tableau, Looker, other)
